# Government Signal Tracking System

## Overview

The Government Signal Tracking System monitors procurement opportunities across multiple regions, identifies service gaps and bottlenecks, and manages government stakeholder relationships. It provides automated "homework assignments" to identify pre-budget chaos and vendor gaps as outlined in the PRD.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Region Procurement Monitoring
- **Supported Regions**: EU, US, UK, Singapore, UAE, and country-specific tracking
- **Tender Lifecycle**: Track from upcoming to awarded status
- **Value Tracking**: Estimated contract values with currency support
- **Deadline Management**: Automatic alerts for approaching deadlines
- **Document Management**: Attach and track tender documents

### 2. Service Gap & Bottleneck Analysis
- **Service Gap Detection**: Identify procurements with no clear incumbent
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Spot institutional pain points
- **Gap Analysis**: Document opportunities for intervention
- **Win Probability**: Assess likelihood of success
- **High-Leverage Flagging**: Automatic alerts for best opportunities

### 3. Government Contact Management
- **Stakeholder Database**: Track key decision makers
- **Role Classification**: Implementation leads, policy makers, tender authorities
- **Influence Mapping**: Low to Key Decision Maker levels
- **Contact Details**: Email, phone, LinkedIn integration
- **Relationship Notes**: Track interactions and context

### 4. Regional Intelligence
- **Regional Summaries**: Procurement activity by region
- **Value Analysis**: Total contract values by geography
- **Opportunity Distribution**: Service gaps per region
- **Trend Identification**: Spending patterns and priorities

## UI Components

### Summary Dashboard
- **Metrics Cards**:
  - Total tenders with open count
  - Aggregate contract value
  - Service gap opportunities
  - Identified bottlenecks
  - Urgent deadlines (7-day window)

### Procurement List
- **Comprehensive View**: All procurement details at a glance
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Status badges
  - Value displays
  - Service gap/bottleneck flags
  - Deadline warnings (red border for urgent)
- **Quick Actions**: Edit, view details, delete
- **Related Data**: Contact and document counts

### Contact Management
- **Grid Layout**: Visual contact cards
- **Influence Badges**: Color-coded by decision-making power
- **Contact Methods**: Direct email/phone/LinkedIn links
- **Relationship Context**: Linked opportunities and procurements

### Regional Analysis Tab
- **Regional Cards**: Procurement summary by geography
- **Key Metrics**: Count, total value, open tenders, service gaps
- **Comparative View**: Identify most active regions

## API Endpoints

### Procurement Endpoints
```
GET /api/procurement
Query params: region, status, serviceGap, bottleneck, days
Returns: procurements, stats, regionSummary

POST /api/procurement
Creates alerts for deadlines and gaps/bottlenecks

PATCH /api/procurement/[id]
Updates procurement details

DELETE /api/procurement/[id]
```

### Government Contacts
```
GET /api/government-contacts
Query params: opportunityId, influence, department, search
Returns: contacts, departmentSummary, influenceDistribution

POST /api/government-contacts
Links to opportunities if specified
```

## Automated Intelligence

### Alert Generation
1. **Deadline Alerts**: 
   - HIGH priority: Due within 7 days
   - MEDIUM priority: Due within 30 days
   
2. **Opportunity Alerts**:
   - Service gaps trigger MARKET_SIGNAL alerts
   - Bottlenecks create HIGH priority notifications
   - Action required flags for immediate attention

### Homework Assignments (Future Enhancement)
- Weekly regional analysis automation
- Vendor leak audits from contract awards
- High-leverage offer generation templates

## Usage Workflow

### Procurement Tracking
1. **Monitor**: Regular review of new tenders across regions
2. **Identify**: Flag service gaps and bottlenecks
3. **Analyze**: Document gap analysis and opportunity assessment
4. **Prepare**: Draft proposals for high-leverage opportunities
5. **Track**: Monitor status through to award

### Contact Building
1. **Map**: Identify key stakeholders for target procurements
2. **Profile**: Assess influence levels and roles
3. **Connect**: Build relationships with decision makers
4. **Document**: Track all interactions and insights
5. **Leverage**: Use contacts for intelligence and positioning

## Best Practices

### Service Gap Identification
- Look for vague requirements indicating uncertainty
- New regulatory areas without established vendors
- Cross-border or multi-jurisdiction needs
- Technology gaps in traditional institutions

### Bottleneck Recognition
- Repeated failed tenders
- Extensions and clarifications indicating confusion
- Budget allocations without clear execution plans
- Policy mandates without implementation resources

### Relationship Management
- Map entire decision-making chains
- Focus on KEY_DECISION_MAKERS but maintain broad network
- Document all interactions immediately
- Link contacts to specific opportunities

## Integration Points

### With Opportunities
- Procurements can influence opportunity scoring
- Government contacts linked to regulatory opportunities
- Combined intelligence for positioning

### With Competitive Intelligence
- Monitor competitor tender applications
- Track which competitors target which regions
- Identify competitive gaps in procurement

## Future Enhancements

- Automated tender scraping from TED, USA.gov, etc.
- Predictive bottleneck identification
- Contract award pattern analysis
- Vendor performance tracking
- Automated proposal generation for common gaps
